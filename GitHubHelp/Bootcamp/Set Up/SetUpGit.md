设置 Git

At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.

GitHub 的核心是一个名为 Git 的 开源版本控制系统 （VCS）。Git 负责于计算机本地发生的所有GitHub相关的事务。

To use Git on the command line, you'll need to download, install, and configure Git on your computer.

要在命令行上使用Git，您需要在计算机上下载，安装和配置Git。

If you want to work with Git locally, but don't want to use the command line, you can instead download and install the GitHub Desktop client.
For more information, see "Getting Started with GitHub Desktop."

如果您想在本地使用Git，但不想使用命令行，则可以下载并安装GitHub Desktop客户端。有关更多信息，请参阅“ GitHub桌面入门 ”。

If you don't need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including:

如果您不需要在本地处理文件，GitHub可让您直接在浏览器中完成许多与Git相关的操作，包括：


Creating a repository

创建一个存储库

Forking a repository

分拣一个存储库

### Setting up Git

Download and install the latest version of Git.
Set your username in Git.
Set your commit email address in Git.

### Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git

When you connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH.

**Connecting over HTTPS (recommended)**
If you clone with HTTPS, you can cache your GitHub password in Git using a credential helper.

**Connecting over SSH**
If you clone with SSH, you must generate SSH keys on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.
